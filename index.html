  <h1>Exploring the Number of Sanitation Related Complaints</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>
      What neighborhoods report the highest number of sanitation-related complaints (e.g., missed garbage collection, dirty conditions), and what types of complaints are most reported?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> Cleanliness is an important quality metric that can impact public health and neighborhood reputation. With some blocks littered with trash and illegal dumping, while others are spotless, sanitation issues affect health, property values, and overall quality of life. </p> <p> Therefore, we can research to see which neighborhoods reported the highest number of sanitation-related complaints and observe if there's a trend over time. </p> <p> Understanding where and when sanitation problems occur can help city agencies such as the Department of Sanitation, local officials, and even community boards allocate resources more efficiently and address persistent issues. </p>

    <h2>The Data You Will Use to Address Your Question</h2>
    <p>
      The data source used for this project was the 311 NYC OpenData with the data filtered down from all Departments to only the Department of Sanitation since that is the one we were focusing on. Some variables that were vital in further researching this question are the Complaint types, the amount of complaints for each type, and the date the complaints were created.

    <h2>An Explanation of the Data and Design Decisions You Made</h2>
    <p>
      I chose a bar graph in order to represent the sanitation complaints by neighborhood because it effectively visualizes the number of complaints across different zip code in a straightforward way. To keep the focus on the most impacted areas, I only included the top 15 neighborhoods with the highest count of complaints since other neighborhoods are not relevant to the research question. This makes the visualization easier to interpret and more impactful. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      For the trend of the number of complaints over time, a line graph was the most appropriate choice since it clearly shows the fluctuation in sanitation complaints month by month. This allows us to observe patterns, seasonal spikes, or long-term changes effectively while not being overwhelmed. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      To show which complaint types were most common, I used a pie chart which provides an intuitive visual breakdown of the proportion that each type contributes to the overall volume of complaints. The viewer is able to take in the highest and lowest number of complaints since it visually represents the categories in sizes. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      One limitation of the project was the sheer size of the original dataset. Even after filtering the data to include only sanitation-related complaints, the file was too large to process efficiently. As a result, I had to compromise by narrowing the time frame to focus on a more manageable dataset. I decided to choose the previous 5 years as the time frame which allowed for meaningful analysis and providing insights. 
      </p>

    <h2>Data Explained </h2>
    <p>
      The bar chart regarding sanitation complaints by neighborhood shows that the most sanitation complaints came from the neighborhood/zipcode 11385 which is associated with Ridgewood, Queens NY. This is shown in the bar chart where the left most identified neighborhood is 11385 with a count of 32,470 complaints. We excluded the “Null” zip code from the analysis as those most likely represent records with incomplete or missing location data. This can point to ongoing sanitation issues such as inconsistent garbage collection, a high number of bulk item requests, or possible gaps in the services. It also reflects a more engaged population that is using 311 to report issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the line chart, it reveals a spike in October 2021 where the city recorded 61,221 sanitation complaints, which is the highest in the 5-year range. After this peak, there was a noticeable downward trend as it started to become steady starting from June 2022. This could be linked to post-pandemic recovery efforts, service backlogs, or large-scale cleanups. The decrease afterwards could be explained through increased service efficiency, new policies or public outreach efforts.
    </p>

<p>
  In the complaint type breakdown visualization, it clearly shows that the “Request Large Bulky Item Collection” category accounted for the largest number of sanitation-related 311 requests with a total of 572,843 complaints. Other types of complaints were significantly less reported. This could imply that a significant portion of sanitation complaints aren’t necessarily about service failures but rather service requests. This could reflect the limitation of curbside pickup services, changes in consumer behavior or a lack of awareness about alternative disposal options.
