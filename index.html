  <h1>Exploring the Number of Sanitation Related Complaints</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>
      What neighborhoods report the highest number of sanitation-related complaints (e.g., missed garbage collection, dirty conditions), and what types of complaints are most reported?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Cleanliness is an important quality metric that can impact public health and neighborhood reputation. With some blocks littered with trash and illegal dumping, while others are spotless, sanitation issues affect health, property values and overall quality of life. Therefore, we can research to see which neighborhoods reported the highest number of sanitation-related complaints and see if there's a trend over time. Understanding where and when sanitation problems occur can help city agencies such as the Department of Sanitation, local officials, and even community boards allocate resources more efficiently and address persistent issues.

    <h2>The Data You Will Use to Address Your Question</h2>
    <p>
      The data source used for this project was the 311 NYC OpenData with the data filtered down from all Departments to only the Department of Sanitation since that is the one we were focusing on. Some variables that were vital in further researching this question are the Complaint types, the amount of complaints for each type, and the date the complaints were created.

    <h2>An Explanation of the Data and Design Decisions You Made</h2>
    <p>
      I chose the bar graph because it was able to easily represent each zip code (neighborhoods) and it quantifies the amount of complaints per neighborhood without having other unnecessary features. I also only included the top 15 neighborhoods since we are not concerned with the least complaint neighborhood. This was the best fit for finding out which neighborhoods had the most sanitation related complaints. For the trendline, I decided to go with the line graph since it visualizes how the amount of complaints moved per month and a line graph best fits this situation due to how it conveys a volatile situation of increasing or decreasing complaints. For which complaints were most dominant overall in the Department of Sanitation was a pie chart, where it visualizes percentages in how large each slice is which is intuitive to understand and comprehend. Some limitations of the data was how large the starting data set was. Even filtering down the data to only contain Department of Santiation’s complaints, it was too large to handle to download and therefore I had to reduce the time frame to only 5 years (2020 - 2025).

    <h2>Data Explained </h2>
    <p>The bar chart regarding the sanitation complaints by neighborhood shows that the most sanitation complaints came from the neighborhood/zipcode 11385 which is associated with Ridgewood, Queens NY.  This can be found in the figure where the left most identified neighborhood is 11385 with a count of 32,470 complaints. We excluded the “Null” zip code from the analysis as those most likely represent records with incomplete or missing location data. This can point to ongoing sanitation issues such as inconsistent garbage collection, a high number of bulk item requests, or possible gaps in the services. It also reflects a more engaged population that is using 311 to report issues. In the line chart, it reveals a spike in October 2021 where the city recorded 61,221 sanitation complaints, which is the highest in the 5-year range. After this peak, there was a noticeable downward trend as it started to become steady starting from June 2022. This could be linked to post-pandemic recovery efforts, service backlogs, or large-scale cleanups. The decrease afterwards could be explained through increased service efficiency, new policies or public outreach efforts. In the complaint type breakdown visualization, it clearly shows that the “Request Large Bulky Item Collection” category accounted for the largest number of sanitation-related 311 requests with a total of 572,843 complaints. Other types of complaints were significantly less reported. This could imply that a significant portion of sanitation complaints aren’t necessarily about service failures but rather service requests. This could reflect the limitation of curbside pickup services, changes in consumer behavior or a lack of awareness about alternative disposal options.</p>
